Problem:

Sometimes its good to send individual updates (eg. 1 character is updated) and sometimes its bad(180 characters updated)

How do we decide to send individual updates, update by row, update entire screen, etc?
    Benchmarking?  What would we benchmark?
How do we generate the jpgs in code for each individual update image?
