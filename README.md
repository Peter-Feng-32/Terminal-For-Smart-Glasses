# ToozKit

[Termux](https://termux.com) is an Android terminal application and Linux environment.

This is a hack for Termux that allows it to display live captioning to Tooz smart-glasses.  The intended use is for people in the deaf/HoH community who want to have a more subtle interface for live captioning.  Publication pending at ISWC 2023
